The list of known typos in the Russian Synodal Bible
====================================================

The edition of the Russian Synodal Bible I used to find these typos is the one
published by the Trinitarian Bible Society, ISBN: 1862281084.
The latest version of this file can be always obtained from:

To get the exact letters to be used in typesetting, get the KOI-8 version of

Part I. Typos
=============

1. Genesis 49:1		"budem s vami" should be "budet s vami"

2. Genesis 21:14	"plecha" should be "plechi"

3. Genesis 31:29	"nashego" should be "vashego"

4. Exodus 1:10		"protivu" should be "protiv"

5. Levit. 6:21		"pri-Gospodu" should be "prinosi ee v prijatnoe blagouchanie Gospodu".
			This one is very interesting. It seems that the different editions of the
			Synodal Text strive to keep the 1-1 match between the chapter/verse and the
			page numbers. This means that a given verse will always occur on the same
			page no matter what edition one is holding in his hands. Now, if one
			were to correct this [obvious] typo then the page numbering match will
			break. So, some editions (e.g. the Moscow 1989 edition I have) have typeset
			this verse (Lev 6:21) in smaller type, thus keeping the page count
			unchanged.

6. Numbers 23 (preface)	"prokinantija" should be "proklinanija"

7. Leviticus 23:27	"devjatij" (9th) should be "desjatij" (10th). Indeed,
			KJV and all other trustworthy translations say "tenth
			day" but the real proof is obtained by checking the
			Hebrew original, where we find "beashor", i.e. based
			on the word 6218 from Strong's Concordance which is
			never translated as 9 but always as 10 (because
			"ashor" means 10!) So, whether this is a deliberate
			mistranslation or a typo, it should be corrected.
			It is important to know when the feasts of our Lord
			occur so we can keep them in their proper seasons.

8. 1Kings 1:35		"vmestvo" should be "vmesto". The Moscow edition of
			the Russian Synodal Bible has corrected this one.

9. 2Kings 9:24		"serdca" should be "serdce"
			Moscow edition has the correct spelling. Henceforth
			I won't repeat this fact because Moscow edition seems
			to have almost all the typos corrected.

10. 2Kings 23:1		"ki" should be "k"

11. 1Chr 6:3		"Mojsej" should be "Moisej"

12. 1Chr 15:18		"Iaa ziila" should be "Iaa-ziila", i.e. a hyphen '-'
			for carrying forward onto the next line is missing.

13. Psalms 19:8		"kolesnicmai" should be "kolesnicami"

14. Psalms 45:3		"dvignulis'" should be "dvinulis'"


Part II. Mistranslations
========================

1. 3Kings 12:20		Here the translator seems to have followed Septuagint
			instead of remaining faitful to the Hebrew. Namely he
			added "i Veniamina", i.e. "and the tribe of Benjamin",
			albeit in italic. I suggest this to be removed as is
			done in all good English and non-English translations
			that I have checked.
